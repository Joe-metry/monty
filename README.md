A brief overview of what Stack and Queue are in C Programming:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Stack:
------

In C programming, a stack is a data structure that stores
and manages data in a "last in, first out" (LIFO) order.
It is a simple and efficient way to manage data that needs to
be accessed in a specific order, such as when undoing an action
or evaluating an expression.

A stack is composed of two main operations: push and pop.
When an element is pushed onto the stack, it is added to the top
of the stack. When an element is popped from the stack, the
element at the top of the stack is removed.

The stack is implemented using an array or a linked list in C.
The array implementation uses a fixed-size array to hold the
data, while the linked list implementation uses a series of nodes
linked together.

Stacks are commonly used in C programming for various applications,
including evaluating mathematical expressions, parsing text, and
implementing recursive algorithms.

==================================================================

Queue:
------

In C programming, a queue is a data structure that stores and
manages data in a "first in, first out" (FIFO) order. It is a
simple and efficient way to manage data that needs to be accessed
in a specific order, such as processing requests or messages.

A queue is composed of two main operations: enqueue and dequeue.
When an element is enqueued, it is added to the back of the queue.
When an element is dequeued, the element at the front of the queue
is removed.

The queue is implemented using an array or a linked list in C. The
array implementation uses a fixed-size array to hold the data, while
the linked list implementation uses a series of nodes linked together.

Queues are commonly used in C programming for various applications,
including handling requests, managing messages, and processing events
in real-time systems. They are also used in algorithms such as
breadth-first search and job scheduling.
